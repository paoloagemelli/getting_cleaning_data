* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

** Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  

*** Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

walking

walkingupstairs

walkingdownstairs

sitting

standing

laying

**** Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. The names of the attributes are similar to the following:

tbodyacc-mean-x 

tbodyacc-mean-y 

tbodyacc-mean-z 

tbodyacc-std-x 

tbodyacc-std-y 

tbodyacc-std-z 

tgravityacc-mean-x 

tgravityacc-mean-y

***** From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
